tt is a time tracker for the command line.


Introduction
============
I looked around for a time tracking tool that can be used from the command line
independent from the computer I use. I did not find any solution I wanted to 
use over a longer period.
That said, tt is tailored for my (very basic) needs: To keep an eye on my
working hours when I am in home office and to track time whenever I work on one
of my side projects. Until now, I used a macOS-only solution called Tyme2. I
liked it a lot and wanted to have something comparable on the shell using an
open and human-readable file format.


Installation
============
I tried to keep tt as simple as possible. It has been written in Python 3 but
does not have any external dependencies so far. This makes the installation
easy as long as you have Python 3 (not 2!) installed on your machine:
  1. Clone the project or download it as an archive and unpack it
  2. Move the tt file to some location existing in your PATH
     (or create a symlink)
  3. If you don't like the name: rename the file or create a symlink


Usage
=====
 Generic commands 
     Commands to initialize tt and perform management tasks.

     cleanup/c             Cleanup and reorganize data file
     init                  Initialize new data file
     log                   Show activity log
     log disable           Disable activity log
     log enable            Enable activity log
     status/st             Display tracker status information


 Projects 
     Before you can start a tracker you need to create a project to which this tracker is assigned. These commands allow you to add, delete and manage existing projects.

     add/a project name    Add new project with name "project name"
     delete/d 23           Delete project with id 23
     list/l                List projects and their ids
     rename 23 new name    Rename project with ID 23 to "new name"


 Tracking 
     These commands allow to start and stop trackers as well as displaying tracked times in existing projects.

     cancel/c              Cancel active tracker and dismiss time
     change/ch 23          Chance project assigned to an active tracker
     pause/p               Pause an active tracker
     pause/p disable       Disable tracking of pause times
     pause/p enable        Enable tracking of pause times
     resume/r              Resume tracker from paused project or from last project used
     show/s                Show tracked times for all projects
     show/s 23             Show tracked times and some additional information for project 23
     start 23              Start time tracking for project id 23
     stop                  Stop active time tracking
     switch/sw 23          Switch a tracker to a new project by stopping it and starting a new



Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I don't like the name tt
------------------------
You are free to rename it or create a symlink with some name you really like.
This should not cause any problems.

I don't like the data file's name
---------------------------------
You can change the program and specify a data file name you like. It is open
source software for exactly that reason (and others...)

I found a bug!
--------------
Great. I would be happy to hear from you. You can either contact me via
GitHub or - even better - you can fix the bug and send a pull request that
allows me to merge your fix into the main branch.

I want to use tt on several computers, how can I synchronize the data?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, this is also my use case. I initialize a new datafile on one
of my computers, move it to my Dropbox folder and create a symlink in my
home directory pointing to this file. I create this symlink on all machines
where I want to use tt:
	1. tt init
	2. mv .tt.json ~/Dropbox/tt.json
	3. ln -s ~/Dropbox/tt.json ~/.tt.json
Whenever you modify your local data it is synced to the other machines.
Yes, you can use other synchronization tools as well. 

I want to use my phone as time tracking device. Is there an app?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hipster.
But you can create a virtual machine at Amazon, install your favorite
operating system and run tt via SSH. Or you write your own app (see next
question).

What file format is used to store the data?
-------------------------------------------
tt stores it's data in plain text and in human readable JSON format. tt
does not compress the file and even uses a very human-friendly formatting
to make sure that everyone can review and modify its data.
But beware! If you mess up the file, tt will not work until you fix the
problem or re-initialize tt (via tt init).
The usual location of the hidden data file is right in your home: ~/.tt.json
Have a look at the tt-sample.json file to get an impression.

What does "cleanup and reorganize" mean?
----------------------------------------
During the use of tt projects may be created and deleted. However, the ID
assigned to a new project is always the successor of the last ID assigned.
When deleting an earlier project there might be holes and the project IDs
are not consecutive anymore. When calling the cleanup function new IDs
are assigned to the projects eliminating these holes and re-establish a
consecutive list of IDs.
